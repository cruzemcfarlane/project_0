		<p>I am currently doing a double major in Economics & Computer Science, which I am excelling in. However, I would like the opportunity to hone my skills as it relates to real world experience in the field of computing. I realize that the basic school curriculum will not prepare me adequately for the real-world, and it is for this reason why I find the need for internship very necessary.</p>

		<p>I want to formally state that this letter is not a job application letter, but a request for an opportunity to offer my skills, time and energy in exchange for real-world experience in the computing industry. I am a very detailed oriented person, who is very organized, and always on time. I pay very close attention to details, and always try to find more efficient methods of doing things.</p><br />
